    <p>
    I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.

    <p>
    I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a> with a B.S. and from Stony Brook University with a M.S. in 2015 and 2016 respectively, after which I spent some time at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/">BNL</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    My research interests lie in machine learning and data mining, model mechanisms and applications.

    <p>
    Recently I have a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08900">paper</a> about applying spectral graph methods on word embedding accepted by KDD19 as a research track <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ShiboYao/ShiboYao.github.io/blob/master/KDD19Yao.pdf">oral</a> paper.
